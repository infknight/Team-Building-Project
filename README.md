# Team-Building-Project
This is the project to build teams in java
This is the first java project that I have done. In fact, it is my first time learning java, and it was not tough for me because as a Computer Science student, learning a language is a required skill.
This project creates a good team building. The csv file contains student's section and their java level. 
The goal is to pair people into its own section, and java level 1 pair with java level 5. 
The result is write to the result.txt, and there some some errors in the file. It is written to the error.txt
